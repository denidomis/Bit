              <p>
                One DnD (or DnD 6e, as we were calling it until recently) is
                coming next year – though we’re still waiting on a specific One
                DnD release date. Regardless, the clock is certainly ticking
                down towards what’ll be, in effect, a brand new edition of the
                world’s biggest tabletop roleplaying game. In this guide, we’ll
                keep you updated on every key detail of One DnD as we hear about
                it.
